# Davefiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, managed using [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). These configuration files set up my development environment with various tools and customizations.

They don't include my [Setapp](https://setapp.com) rig, I just hit the favorite heart and download ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Customization

Feel free to fork this repository and modify the configurations to suit your needs. Remember to update the Brewfile if you add or remove any packages.

## Notes

- This setup is optimized for macOS with Herd for PHP development.
- The configuration includes settings for multiple PHP versions (7.4 to 8.4) managed by Herd.
- NVM (Node Version Manager) is configured to work with Herd.
- The `.hushlogin` file suppresses the system copyright notice, last login time, and mail check that normally appears when opening a new terminal session.
- Some configurations may need adjusting based on your specific system and preferences.
